# First ride with Pony

The missing step-by-step pony tutorial.

In this tutorial we will build a Raft cluster from the ground up. In each step
we'll introduce new concepts, techniques, Pony idioms, caveats, tips and tricks.

The code of the pony-raft project is [hosted on github](https://github.com/lisael/pony-raft)

> Note: I'm a Pony noob, not a guru. The code, tips and tricks in this tutorial

## What is Pony, anyway?

Well... I guess, if you ask this question, that you have to shut down your computer
and take a walk. You already clicked too much, too far. How the hell did you find this
book??

Anyway, I don't judge, and I gladly welcome any reader, but I think that reading
this tutorial requires at least a partial understanding of [the official
tutorial](http://tutorial.ponylang.org/). If you didn't yet, read it and come back
here. Don't be afraid if you don't catch all the subtleties, especially on
[capabilities](http://tutorial.ponylang.org/capabilities/),
Pony needs practice, and practicing is precisely what we're about to do here.

## Why this book?

I'm new to Pony (who isn't?). At the moment, learning Pony requires a lot of
personal investment. Parts of Pony are simply not documented yet. One has to
read a lot of code, even the compiler itself, and the few available examples to
figure out how some Pony constructs work (`delegate`,
[~~generics~~](http://tutorial.ponylang.org/generics/ "Thanks @doublec")...).
I'm not sure I can fill the blanks in [the official
tutorial](http://tutorial.ponylang.org/) already. Building a mid-sized project
and explaining every line of code are two great ways to learn a language.

## Why Pony?

Short answer: because it's fun and fresh.

## What is Raft?

Citing [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_%28computer_science%29):

> "Raft is a consensus algorithm designed as an alternative to Paxos. It was
> meant to be more understandable than Paxos by means of separation of logic, but
> it is also formally proven safe and offers some new features. Raft offers a
> generic way to distribute a state machine across a cluster of computing
> systems, ensuring that each node in the cluster agrees upon the same series of
> state transitions."

The main resource to Raft is the [reference
paper](https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/wiki/download/attachments/11370504/raft.pdf).
Throughout this tutorial we will base our implementation on this paper, and
hopefully achieve a full-spec implementation.

A lot of resources are available at https://raft.github.io/ and the reader
doesn't have to read the long reference paper to start the tutorial. This [10
minutes tour](http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/) of Raft is enough to
understand where the tutorial goes.

## Why Raft?

Raft is, to me, the perfect project for this kind of exercise, especially for
Pony.

* It's large enough
* It's not too large
* It has a well defined and bounded scope
* It relies on asynchronous calls, where Pony excels
* It relies on network
* I know the algorithm
* It's fun and useful (think etcd. It relies on Raft)

## Who are you?

Just a Free Software enthusiast, seeking The Perfect Programming Language.

During this quest I started dreaming about an new keyword in Python: `actor`
that defines an asynchronous class that run in a separate thread with their own
GIL. I still had to find a smart way to check if a variable can be sent to an
actor or GC'd. I read about capabilities, and eventually I found Pony which
does exactly what I imagined and many more (compile time type checking, pattern
matching, generics...)

I mostly work with Python and C and played a bit with hipsters stuff like Go,
Rust and Erlang/Elixir. I also know a bit of old Java 1.5.

## Can I help?

Yes! Fork the repo and send a metric ton of pull request goodness. You may also
fill an issue on [github](https://github.com/lisael/first-ride-with-pony) As I
hope you did not guess yet, I'm not a native English speaker. I won't get upset
at all if the PR/issue is about grammar, spelling, syntax or vocabulary.
